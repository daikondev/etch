## Etch-a-Sketch

This is my submission for the etch-a-sketch challenge on The Odin Project.

### Goals:
- [] Create an interactive grid.
- [] Allow the grid dimensions to change by changing how many pixels it is made from.
- [] Create a tool which allows you to paint the grid with a single color.
- [] Create an eraser tool.
- [] Create a color-wheel which allows you to change the color you're using.
- [] Create a shading tool, which adds 10% opacity of whatever color you're using to a pixel.
Multiple passes of the same color should reapply the color additively.
- [] (Probably not happening) Create a functionality which allows you to download your drawing.
